# project-site-template

This is a template repo.

Use it to quickly setup a site, hosted on GitHub, for your project or team.

We use it in our [learn by making labs](https://learnbymaking.wales/en/the-labs/) to encourage participants to work in the open and regularly share what they are learning.

### Documentation

We have included some [documentation](./_docs/README.md) to help you get started and customise your project site.

### Credit

The theme we use for the project site template is based on the [Scriptor theme](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/scriptor).
