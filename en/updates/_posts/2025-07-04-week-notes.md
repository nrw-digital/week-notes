## This week we've: 

* bug fixed forms including checking links to external content work correctly, document upload settings are at maximum upload capacity and checking the wording of confirmation emails  
* started design thinking on one 'change a bird licence' form to replace four separate forms 
* presented user feedback and our one year review of the 'using land we manage' service 
* had Devs working on a new accordion component and improving our searchable tables
* started a content audit for the new recruitment platform 
* started reviewing the user feedback surveys for online forms 
* got together in design huddles about content audits and form building
* been looking at the report and incident page – the aim is to understand why information we need from users, simplify the page and encourage more people to report and incident online 
* stayed optimistic that various parts will come together for us to deliver a service with a GOV.UK Pay payment option 
* joined a ways of working session with the customer platform team (mainly observing, but also ensuring user-centred design has its place in the plan). There will be regular sessions for team members outside the delivery team to review, ask questions, and contribute
* met with the species team to review the revised structure for bird licensing pages

## What we're learning about 

* Heledd joined a couple of [Camp Digital sessions online](https://www.nexerdigital.com/campdigital/2025/schedule/). She said that she enjoyed Matt Juke’s talk on working in the open, and Alex Blandford and Katherine Wastell’s “Getting things moving in a system that doesn’t want to” – lots of reflections that resonated 
* Sam joined [Public Digital data bites session #57](https://public.digital/data-bites-series/data-bites-57). The 'reporting environmental incidents online session' was very relevant to us. It's interesting to see how they're using PowerApps and the Dataverse to push incident data into their system: better, real-time and consistent data.  

## Coming soon 

Lucinda has offered Figma training to the team
