Here’s what the Digital team have been up to this week… 

+ Sophie has been updating key webpages such as the drainage rate information for the 2026/27 period. 
+ The publishing team has been busy performing accessibility audits across evidence reports and important guidance documents to ensure content is accessible and inclusive.
+ Jane and Mary have made progress with trying out the new accordion feature on some Days Out web pages. They will be doing more research into this and hope to be able to write some guidelines on when and how to use the feature soon.
+ Mary has started to pull together ideas ready to deliver some training to new staff in the Communications team about how to publish news and blogs.
+ Sam and Jane had a meeting with forest management plan subject matter experts. Their main focus for this week is exploring to what extent the form needs to be editable post-submission. 
+ Sam published page patterns and guidance in the team WiKi, such as start pages, confirmation pages and step-by-step navigation.
+ Laura and Phil added routing and more logic to the ‘change a species licence’ form, this is with subject matter experts for review. They’ve also been working on other design ideas, focusing on what they can improve now and planning strategies for future iterations. 
+ Heledd attended the Centre for Digital Public Services Doleni Digidol event in Llandudno with Tracey and Tom from the NRW DDAT management team. The focus was on Digital Inclusion, and the new [Minimum Digital Standard](https://mdls.org.uk/about/). Sion from the Older People’s Commission highlighted ‘digital ageism’ and the need to include older people in user research and service design. The key takeaway was public sector responsibility to ensure services are accessible for all - digital first, not digital by default.
