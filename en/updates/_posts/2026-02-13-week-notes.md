With half term holidays looming, it's been a busier week than usual and our team's been working flat out to make sure no deadlines are missed.

## This week, we have been up to: 

+ Mary has continued to prepare content for Comms training, including blogs and news releases. She's also compiled some questions on content types section of Content Strategy. 

+ James has been arranging new workshops for our intranet improvement project. He's also been writing a how to guide for doing desk research for our team wiki. He also shared user research insights about our 'How to comply with your environmental permit' guidance. 

+ Mary and Jane have continued to explore the detail of major changes to parking arrangements at Coed y Brenin visitor centre, Bwlch Nant yr Arian visitor centre and Newborough. Their work this week included meeting with Comms, reviewing signage and continuing to ask the right questions to ensure that web content is clear and consistent. They've now produced an initial draft of content for one of the sites. 

+ Sam and Jane have continued to update the forest management plan prototype and made more progress on the design work. Jane shared the latest designs and concepts with subject matter experts this week in a positive and productive meeting.  

+ Sophie has published the updated public registers on our website this week. She also created a number of accessible reports and PDFs so they can be published to the website.   

+ Laura and Phil continued refining the change a species licence form. They reviewed each section thoroughly - improving the content, updating and checking links, and making sure all routing throughout the form works perfectly. 

+ Hannah published two new pages of “end of waste” guidance this week, overseen by Sam. These pages will help waste producers to understand legislation, comply with standards, and review and improve processes.
