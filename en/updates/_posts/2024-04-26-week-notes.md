Short but sweet this week. There’s a lot more work, and work around the work going on behind the scenes.

## A new place to work in Cardiff

After many long years (well it feels like it was) and many, many, many false starts and a lot of disorganisation / misinformation - Kim, Owain and Phil spent their first day in the new office. 

It was lovely to see each other and have a proper face to face catch up. We also got the chance to have a proper catch up with other teams, such as permitting. The new office is very modern and very, very warm. We have our own quiet work area, quality desks and state of the art meeting rooms. Although Owain is not a fan of the new chairs.

Lunchtime arrived and we tried the café on the third floor, it certainly lived up to our expectations. We will be back next week.

## You may notice some changes 

Owain has been making some improvements to our weeknotes website. Scroll down and take a look at our new footer. It comes with a dazzling ‘contact us’ button and enticing ‘back to top’ link.

There is also a skip to main contact link at the top of the site.

And to top it all off, these updates also work bilingually. He does spoil us.

Much obliged, Owain.

## Other stuff we’ve been working on this week…

+ Lucinda has been working alongside the team in the Flood Warning Information System for Wales (FWISW) to do a full review of the service. The focus being on keeping things consistent and navigation.
+ Lucinda is looking forward to getting together with the FWISW product team in Cardiff next week! (and maybe seeing some Cardiff digital team members in a pub after)
+ Sophie's been reviewing past reports to share findings and best practice with teams who are coming into the reporting time of year.
+ Heledd’s been interviewing for two new web developers to join a new permanent team to look after and develop our website. Exciting!
+ James met with colleagues in our Permit Reform group to start planning user research for people applying for permits. 
+ Several meetings about refining work requests with other teams to understand more, to help us plan, prioritise and manage expectations.
