September is here, schools are open again, the rain has returned, that's another week done for the digital team....

## Getting our priorities straight 

The team has a new set of priorities for the next few months. We’re moving towards having a balance of project-work and business as usual tasks. It’s a shift from the old way of working where we tried to manage many conflicting organisational demands. Our team has decided on the scope of the project work and it is based on evidenced user needs, research, and team feedback. 
	
## New recruitment system

Our new e-recruitment system went live this week. The new system has replaced the manual time-consuming processes for recruiting managers, and it should lead to a better online experience for applicants. Mary and Sophie have rewritten and published the many pages of intranet content about our recruitment process to dovetail with the new system. They also edited the internal applicants' page on the intranet to ensure that our staff can easily find information about applying for vacancies. Mary also published the new [Jobs, apprenticeships and placements section](https://naturalresources.wales/about-us/jobs-apprenticeships-and-placements/?lang=en) of our website this week. As well as a link to the e-recruitment system to search and apply for a job, the new pages have content that promotes NRW as a good place to work.
	
## Publishing update bulletin

From the end of September, we’ll have a new monthly “publishing updates” bulletin, which anyone will be able to subscribe to. It will be a short-and-sweet list of all significant publishing updates, such as consultations, evidence reports, board changes, guidance, and more. Hannah will be sending it out on the last working day of each month, working with Sam to decide what is considered “significant”.
	
## Other work we've been doing:
