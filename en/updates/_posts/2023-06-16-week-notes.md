## Content freeze reminder ##

It's been a sweltering week of work so we hope you've all been keeping cool in work if you're not on your holiday just yet. The digital team continue to shine giving focus to our new web content management software but, also, trying to maintain a balance of what absolutely needs to be on the NRW and what can wait until the new software go live in mid-July. If content has to be posted to the site as a necessity, please bear in mind that this will need to posted twice, once on the existing CMS and then again when the new CMS comes into fruition. We asked that you're mindful of this when creating new requests to ensure the team is not double handling content that could have waited until after 12 July 2023.
