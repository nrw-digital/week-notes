Welcome to another week in the Digital Team, here's what we got up to...

## Here are some highlights from the week...

+ Fly-tipping Action Wales has also been high priority work this week as we prepare for the launch of new campaign-style pages on our website - and new campaign resources (on Citizen Space) – to replace their current stand-alone website.  Our work has touched on many parts of NRW: incident reporting processes, devs to repoint users from the old URL to the new, waste policy to check wording of some new guidance, translators and 2i checks within the digital team.  

+ Sam’s added a new process doc to our team WIKI to document how we publish regulatory decisions on our website. This documents how we use our CMS features to make it easier for users to find what they need. We each have lots of knowledge of niche ways of working that we're getting out of our heads and documenting for the entire team.   

+ Shaun met with the Peatland Policy team to discuss how best to approach web guidance for building developers operating near peat bogs. An expert group is currently meeting to draft internal guidance. Being involved at this stage will allow us to switch the focus to user needs for the website and enable us to plan the content around what the developers need to do. 

+ Ahead of the September launch date, Sophie and Mary finished working on the new recruitment content, with Intranet pages that are bilingual with accessible links and an improved structure.  

+ Phil and Sam finished the report of their form bug fixing work ready for a ‘next steps’ session with Heledd and Alex next week.  

+ We’ve had feedback from users of the new fish-eating birds licence application. It’s good that we’re able to change the form and content easily and that more people in the organisation can now see this is a process of learning and iteration rather than an old style ‘task and finish’ approach.   

+ Hannah and Sam chatted about plans for a new monthly NRW publishing update email. We’re hoping to send our first update at the end of September.  

+ Shaun also met with the Planning, Landscape, Energy and Decarbonisation team to talk through a draft of web guidance for electricity infrastructure developers. An Official Guidance Note on planning electricity grid infrastructure has been drafted by the team which is unsuitable as web content.
