Weeknotes 02/02/2023
In the blink of an eye, it’s February. Where did January go? I’m keeping my fingers crossed for warmer days ahead. It’s been good news though for our flooding teams who have finally had a break from all this wet weather.
Well…what’s been happening this week in the digital team.
Sonarr
James has been analysing user interviews to help shape the 2025 Sonarr (State of Natural Resources Report). 
He’s spoken to 6 users from: 

Welsh Government
Dŵr Cymru
Brecon Beacons National Park
RSPB Cymru
NRW teams who work with Public Service Boards

User feedback about Sonarr is similar to what we hear about other NRW services: 

Sonarr is written to answer legislative duties on NRW not user tasks
Users find it time-consuming and laborious to extract the information they need, often having to open every chapter and manually search for words
Few users need evidence at an all-Wales level
It’s difficult to find evidence at a local authority or regional level
NRW holds a lot of relevant regional data but we don’t signpost people to it in Sonarr
The key messages are lost in a narrative structure instead of bullet points
People want NRW to be more confident in saying: “To restore biodiversity this is what needs to happen xxx” 

‘How to comply with your environmental permit’ survey

James has created a survey to gather feedback about how people use the ‘How to comply with your environmental permit’ guidance. 

This has gone out to around 800 industry contacts and should help show how people use the guidance, what are their pain points and whether it meets their user needs. 

We can then hold user interviews to drill down into these themes. 
It’s good when a plan comes together
We have been very busy working to improve the content of the woodlands and forest section of our website. With our new website proposition and tools in our growing Content publishing manual, it feels like we’re well equipped now for the task ahead!
The task this week was to get a plan in place. We had to find out what was happening with each piece of content.
Our mission is to create task focused content. It’s been years since this area has had a make-over. We have outdated pages, and the content is not very accessible or inclusive.
We started this piece of work by having a very productive meeting with our subject matter experts. The experts came from forestry, species and the felling licence teams. The meeting's aim was to get their feedback on the new structure of the woodland management and licences pages.
We got some good feedback, thank you to everyone who took part. Now we have this valuable information, the next step is to create an information architecture. 
The science behind structuring content
Information architecture is about helping people understand their surroundings and find what they’re looking for, in the real world as well as online.
Signage at airports, and tube navigation maps are great examples of information architecture in the real world. They both help people to understand where they are, what's around them, and what to expect.
