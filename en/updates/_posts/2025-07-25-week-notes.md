## What we have been working on this week:
+ This week, Phil, Laura and Alex joined Dave and Ian on a call to talk about the fish-eating birds content and form. 
Last week we sent the form to a user for testing. This week we spent some time updating and improving the form and web content after receiving very good and valuable feedback from the user
+ Phil and Laura made some final changes to the restructured interim bird licensing content pages, a publication date of 30 July has been set. This restructure uses standard patterns across our website and is a huge improvement on the current web content.
+ Phil, Kim and Hannah continue their battle fixing bugs in our online forms. We continue to check that links work correctly and fix document upload settings to make sure they are set to a maximum upload capacity. We only have a handful of forms left to fix.
+ Phil has also been testing a new table feature that has been released onto our test website. The developers have released some new and exciting features, such as an accordion feature and an improved table feature, we now have the task of user testing these new features.
+ Lucinda and the flood warning product team have started an 'innovation sprint' this week. The next 2 weeks will be an opportunity to step back from the current way of working and exploring something new. Lucinda has started research how other countries deliver flood warnings (with a special interest in bilingual services).
+ Lucinda has also been exploring how the flood messaging system can provide quick stats during a flood event. Starting with a workshop exploring who the user is and what they are trying to do.
+ Heledd spent a day helping out at the Natural Resources Wales Royal Welsh Show stand. Her highlights from the show included some prize winning produce (ice cream, cheese and butter), bemusing carrot competition categories, a felted spaniel and a whale made out of a courgette.
