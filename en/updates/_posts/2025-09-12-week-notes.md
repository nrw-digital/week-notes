Highlights from the week in digital. 

+ Heledd met with the Permit Reform Group to agree how the digital team works with permitting and how we can best prioritise work. 
+ Lucinda continued to work on flood message features and improvements and attended a Figma workshop. 
+ James has been working on revising a user needs survey to improve our installations content. 
+ Shaun has been working on Planning and Development content for siting electricity equipment and trying different options for the Planning and Development information architecture. 
+ The publishing team have been busy with numerous annual reports, intranet updates and a new NPAP grant. 
+ Alex has continued to work on Gov Pay. He also had meetings about waste exemptions website content and hazardous waste reporting. 
+ Laura and Phil have been checking the accessibility of our online learning platform and working on scoping out website content concerning birds. They’ve written a blog about the fish eating bird work.  
+ Laura has also been scoping out a project looking at how we can improve the Flood Risk Activity Permit web content. She’ll also be publishing a blog shortly about the review of permissions earlier this year. 
+ Sam has been scoping out work on Forest Management Plans and working to standardise how we collect information on forms.
