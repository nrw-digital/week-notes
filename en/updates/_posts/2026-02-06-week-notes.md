description: What the team's accomplished this week...  

+ Heledd travelled to Cardiff. 3 good days of peopling.

+ Tuesday was a chance for Heledd, Alex and Sam to catch up with Ray: sharing stuff that’s working, what’s not and what we’d like to change. We were encouraged by Ray's enthusiasm and support and Alex has started a new spreadsheet of problems to solve - many of these we’ve known about for a long time but we want to have a plan to and the support to deliver. 

+ Team meeting - we had a great show and tell 'Feathers, flaps and wow' – the story so far in the work to design a better experience for people applying to change their species licence. Some of the team also joined them for a design crit. Really enjoying seeing more of the work and how the team are working / decisions they are making. 

+ On Thursday, Laura, Heledd Sam and Phil attended CDPS community of practice meet up. People from the various communities of practice: content design, service design, user research; AI, and data got together. These types of days are an important reminder that everyone's facing the same challenge, and there's a huge opportunity to continue to learn from each other - and have a safe space to talk about the challenges.  

+ Lucinda and Sophie began an investigation using Google Analytics to understand where users are encountering 404 errors when using our website. They've created an action plan to set up re-directs, undersantnd where broken links may have originated and how we can resolve them. They will continue to monitor this over coming months. 

+ Jane and Sam have been doing more work on the forest management prototype following the decision to test a form that is a mix of document uploads and text fields. They've also been working on designs for other parts of the user journey in preparation for their meeting with subject matter experts next week.  

+ Shaun and Mary carried on writing new intranet content. Shaun also went along to the ICT intranet workshop and worked on web guidance about ascertaining whether a river is classed as a main river. 

+ Jane and Mary have been working together on content relating to new parking charges. They've been asking lots of questions to fully understand the details before they start work on the content. 

+ James published changes to our flood risk content to make it clearer that users have to contact local authorities about 'ordinary watercourses'. He also ran a workshop to gather user needs for our intranet about our ICT service desk and MyNRW application. 

+ Jane also enjoyed joining Phil and Laura in the nest again this week!
