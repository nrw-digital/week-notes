Here's what the Digital Team have been up to this week…

## Teamwork to tackle tables
The publishing officers are working with Sam and Alex on a way to improve tables to reduce workload – how we want to receive them, and how we publish them. 
A recent update to Umbraco (which prevented lots of messy excess code being copy/pasted over from documents) means that tables can no longer easily be copied over. Instead, they have to be saved as their own file, then added as blocks – which is ideal for large tables, or where a page only has one or two tables. 
But for the chunky annual reports, which can contain dozens of smaller tables, this will add a lot of fiddly extra work. Work in progress!

## Other things we’ve been working on:

+ Lucinda has been working on improving a prototype that introduces some new features to our flood messaging app. She’s also been exploring early ideas for how people might export flood message data during and after a flood event
+ Sophie connected with colleagues in the customer hub to understand more about the calls they receive and how we can support by alleviating confusion through clear and informative web content
+ Alex ran a kick start meeting for a discovery project for redesigning NRW’s intranet. The project is expected to run until March. The aim will be to produce a new top tasks (Home Page) using the SharePoint Modern. The team have been empowered to create this page from scratch redesigning the content and IA.
+ James ran a workshop to design the user research approach for understanding our intranet top tasks. He's has been drafting a staff survey to understand how we can improve our intranet.
+ Kim has pulled together a spreadsheet of all of intranet pages with page view star ratings
+ With the intranet improvement project underway, Mary, Shaun and Kim started work on a content audit. There's a lot, which is part of the problem.
+ Shaun is looking at guidance on minimising the visual impacts of building developments and working with the Flood Risk Strategy Team on guidance for owners of riverside properties
+ Sophie attended Climate Literacy Training led by Cynnal Cymru this week. The 8 hour course built on existing climate change knowledge and she especially enjoyed looking at the big picture to find out the most important changes we need to make as a society to reach a zero carbon future.
