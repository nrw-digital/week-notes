Happy Friday! Can you believe it’s nearly October!?

## A team away day in Shrewsbury… ##

This week our team was lucky enough to spend the night in Shrewsbury for a team away day. It was a great chance to come together as a team and look to the future and brainstorm new ways of working collaboratively.

Shrewsbury is an old town, reportedly started in 700AD. With the same mediaeval street plan and over 600 listed buildings, there was plenty to stop and admire. The sun was even shining for some of the trip - lucky us!

Our team’s away day was held at the [Shropshire Wildlife Trust](https://www.shropshirewildlifetrust.org.uk/) , an organisation campaigning for a wilder future and [nature’s recovery](https://www.shropshirewildlifetrust.org.uk/nature-recovery). They offered a great co-working space surrounded by a beautiful garden filled with flowers, herbs and edible fruits. We got to know new members of our team better and get together in the same room and plan ahead. Meeting in person like this provides us with invaluable face-to-face time, where we can brainstorm and bounce ideas off one another in a way that can sometimes be difficult through screens alone.

After a busy day of discussion and collaboration, our team headed to the [Dough and Oil](https://www.doughandoil.com/) for tasty pizza and £4 cocktails! We had a great time and thankfully we all survived a night in one of the UK’s most haunted hotels, the [Prince Rupert Hotel(https://www.hauntedrooms.co.uk/product/prince-rupert-hotel-shrewsbury]. It is the oldest hotel in Shrewsbury and it is surrounded by a structure of Tudor and Georgian architecture and design. 

According to Haunted Rooms, “The Prince Rupert Hotel is said to be haunted by a lot of spirits. Shrewsbury also has a reputation of being one of the most haunted towns in Great Britain. Its dark corners, mediaeval streets and old buildings seem to lend the credence to lure surrounding spectres and ghostly apparitions tied to the hotel. There are more than 500 stories of spectres in the town of Shrewsbury.”

“One of the famous encounters is that of one of the directors of the movie “A Christmas Carol”. He was filming in Shrewsbury and stayed at the hotel, whilst at the hotel, he saw a ghostly male figure which disappeared through a wall in the hall. Pillows have also been taken from guests and some of the guests themselves have even captured the apparitions on camera.”  

Thankfully, we can report that very minimal haunted happenings took place during our stay!
