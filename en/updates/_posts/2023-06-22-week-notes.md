## Applying to do a thing on land we look after
We’re shifting focus from ‘check if you are allowed to use the land we manage, to ‘apply to use land we manage’.
 
Sam and Laura spent the afternoon mapping:
+ who the users are
+ what they want to do
+ why they want to do it
+ where they want to do it
+ when they want to do it

It was a great exercise to make sure we are starting with user needs. It also helped make the task ahead feel less daunting – getting it out of our heads and onto some (virtual) post it notes.

Then it was time to bring out the llamas….yep, you read that correctly, the llamas.

There are some situations where users have to talk to us before they apply. For example, if they want to organise a running race across Wales, or film a blockbuster movie.

We used our llama friends to mark when someone should be able to apply without contacting us. And when they would have to speak to us first. 

Our aim is to make sure that, eventually, they can all apply without any probllamas.

Thanks for that Laura, a pun worthy of Andrew there.

## Medium Combustion Plants and Specified Generators

Andrew has been working on a few forms. A late SRoC related request from water quality on Water Industry Act consents and a couple of forms for Medium Combustion Plant and Specified Generator permits. We’ve taken the decision to split these permits into two application forms, so that those with smaller, less complex MCPs don’t have to worry about some of the more complex requirements that larger plants need to comply with.

Shaun has been continuing work with Claire Watts on the associated web content for medium combustion plants and specified generators. Although it’s a very complex regulatory environment, it’s been a good exercise in pair writing, with Shaun applying his ignorance in an attempt to simplify the language and Claire keeping him factually correct and ensuring he doesn’t over-simplify.

## Strategic Review of Charging (SRoC)
The forthcoming implementation of SRoC has necessitated some more work on preparing the web content on charges.

Shaun, Sam and Phil have been working across most regulatory regimes on this. Safe to say, we’ll all be glad when this large, complex piece of work eventually reaches completion and sees the light of day but we are anticipating a period of dust-settling which will inevitably require ongoing improvements for a few weeks.

We’ve taken the opportunity of improving web content guidance and filling some gaps on the site, particularly in waste and water quality, as well as introducing new digital application forms to replace old PDF forms.

## Reports, accessibility and tables
Sophie’s been working through reports and updates on the web and intranet this week, sharing feedback on accessibility and creating templates for searchable table web-pages.
A little bit of everything, but the variety of tasks kept each day interesting!

## Website security update
Owain has been left questioning his sanity after manually updating close to two thousand links on pre-production.

## GovCamp Cymru
Most of the team headed off to Cardiff to attend Govcamp Cymru on Friday.

GovCamp Cymru bills itself as an unconference for those interested in reimagining public services in Wales.

[If that piques your interest, you can read more and watch a short film on the GovCamp website](https://www.govcamp.cymru/).

Shaun is holding the fort and secretly suspecting there’s still a moratorium on him being allowed out in public after [appearing glowering impatiently on the new CDPS website](https://beta.cdps.wales/).
