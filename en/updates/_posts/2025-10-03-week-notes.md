This wasn't the week we'd planned for - our team get-together in Shrewsbury was postponed and will now go ahead in November.

## Team highlights this week included: 
 
Team Birds held a Great kick-off meeting, sharing ways of working and a high-level plan for the next phase of work for bird licensing improvements. This phase of work will focus on "changing and amending" a licence – something that's not as simple as it sounds! 

Shaun published guidance for developers on sitting electricity infrastructure and started looking at rewriting the guidance for riverside property owners and guidance for developers 
on minimising the impact on landscapes of new developments.   
Lucinda mainly worked on creating a prototype to test with internal users of our flood messaging service.  

Sophie worked on the new Business Plan, formatting webpage copy, building accessible tables and ensuring the HTML webpage content meets our Digital Standards ahead of publishing.    

Some of the team joined the first of the monthly showcases for the Marine Licensing beta phase. It was a recap of discovery, alpha, and what's expected to be delivered by the end of March. We're looking forward to having more regular "design huddles" between our team and the project's design team.  

## Some stuff that Heledd's been reading this week:  
 
[Building a shared understanding of services](https://defradigital.blog.gov.uk/2025/07/31/building-a-shared-understanding-of-services/)   
This is from earlier in the summer, and she'd love to talk more to the team in Defra about this. Service ownership should be a huge enabler of transformation, but for that to happen, you need to know what your services are – another tough nut to crack!  

[Transform Wales Newsletter](https://buttondown.com/transformwales/archive/) A new bulletin from Transform Wales, sharing news about digital in public services.

Reflections on the news about CDPS and Welsh Government (and other fab stuff).
