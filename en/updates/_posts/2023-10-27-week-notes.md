It's Halloween week where our children (and adults) dress up as ghouls and enter the darker spirit of things at parties and enjoy some autumnal fun. We may not have any horror stories to tell you today (some cute) but be sure, we will voice our inner most experiences for working on the NRW website and intranet...and, some of them can be a little scary.

## Friday Cute Fact ##
Did you know a group of otters is called a ‘romp’. ![otterly cute](https://github.com/nrw-digital/week-notes/blob/4f57d48b1928c6083cd84f5b66cd26bfb05b8051/images/otterlycute.png?raw=true) This is due to their playful nature!
