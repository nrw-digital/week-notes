This week Andrew and Phil are looking at the forms on our website, pair writing, trio writing and writing content for our users. This makes a change from Andrew and Phil swapping jokes about Mrs Slocombe. In case you are too young to remember, Mrs Slocombe became famous for starring in a TV sitcom called “are you being served”.

Well moving on…what’s been happening this week in the digital team?


## NRW forms - the digital evolution continues
Phil and Andrew have been as busy as springtime badgers getting their setts ready for new cubs. But, instead of replacing the old bedding for new and digging new chambers, they have been replacing many of the old hard copy species licence forms and making them into new, online versions. They hit a bit of a stump when it came to translating these forms as they were sent in the original hard copy MS Word format making it difficult to see the amends made in the new digital format. We worked with the translation and species team and agreed that any future amends made to these forms were in a digital format as opposed to the outgoing hard copy versions. This solution will really help the digital/species team and further support the translation team to locate any changes on the Welsh side of the forms. A win/win for all and,  best of all, no badgers were harmed in making the digital forms for our new pages.
