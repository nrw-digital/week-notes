As the leaves shed from our trees and rain continues to fall, our flood warnings kick in on the NRW website to warn the good people of Wales of potential flood risks.

As usual, we've had a mega busy week. Heledd and Sam have been involved in interviews for a new Digital post and we’re dealing with the usual deluge of content requests coming into our inbox.

## Flood Risk Management Plan ##
This week, Sophie’s been working hard to deliver the Flood Risk Management Plan documents and accompanying webpage in time for the launch which happened yesterday.

Our content designer, Laura has been on hand to support Sophie and create a clear web page structure that helps users find what they’re looking for. 
We’ve created accessible documents and a user-friendly webpage to list all the content that Flood have produced. 

We’ve worked closely with several contacts in the Flood team, and kept a clear line of communication open to ensure changes are communicated as quickly and efficiently as possible. Lynette, on the Communications team has also been a great support to us in collating all the content and ensuring we meet the various important deadlines facing our team this week. 

## A new look for our online forms ##
We have recently updated our forms system, and Lucinda has been working on designing a new accessible theme for our website forms.
Check out this sneak peek:

![New look forms](https://github.com/nrw-digital/week-notes/blob/c980d3d1a11ce221733ab4ae364d7ad7e8c77923/images/newlookSS.png?raw=true)

It took some time to finalise the branding and usability, but it is now ready for use. 

We will use this new design on all forms across the website shortly.

## Other things we’ve been working on: ##
+ Kim’s been mocking up the changes to the recruitment section of the Intranet 
+ James has been working on the interview guide for user research interviews about filming on NRW land. He’s also 2i-ed (digitally proofread) content about ‘Apply for a water industry act consent’
+ Lucinda and Kim have been working on getting a new online service for recruitment up and running. Expect to see this published next week

## What we're planning
Some much needed weekend rest, reflection and recuperation so we're revived for the week ahead.

## And last but not least, we're keeping an ear out for a fun Friday fact ##
![Cricket ears](https://github.com/nrw-digital/week-notes/blob/02a7e0dc9be8d15e613dc842be2698773010adde/images/cricketear.png?raw=true)

Did you know crickets have ears (or sound receivers) on their legs? They say walls have ears but so do cricket legs it would seem! Who'd have thought?
