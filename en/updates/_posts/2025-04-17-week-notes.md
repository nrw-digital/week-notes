## Welcome to our new team member 

A huge welcome to Hannah who joined our team this week! Hannah met some of the team at the Aberystwyth office and will be Teams meeting us all, in turn, over the next few weeks to learn more about what we do.  

## Species content improvement project 

**Bird licensing: examining form flows to eliminate and simplify**

In another workshop, two species experts and Sam continued studying each question of form for users to apply for a bird licence. 

The team examined why each question was being asked, and how questions that remained were worded. They eliminated several unnecessary questions and simplified/ clarified what was left. 

**Updates to species team leaders**

Alex gave an update on progress to species team leaders. It was also an opportunity to: 

+ discuss ways of working so we make the best use of the time we all have
+ give a glimpse of what we think we could do on the site to meet user and organisation needs 

## How NRW publishes the Habitats Regulations 9A reports  

The team are advising SMEs on publishing the 2025 reports including how to: 

+ create accessible Word and Excel documents
+ make the reports and data as accessible as possible to as many people as possible
+ publish the reports on the site in a way that helps users easily find and download them 

## Fly-tipping Action Wales – continuing the work on moving content to NRW 

With the closure of the Fly-tipping Action Wales website, we’re still moving some content to the NRW site, its new place. This week: 

+ Toyah 2i checked new ‘what to do about fly-tipped waste on your land’ content
+ Sam worked with the SME to revise some content
+ Kim and Sam sent their instructions for setting up a campaign page in Citizen Space to the FtAW team so they can manage it themselves
+ Domains were transferred to NRW

## Publishing spreadsheets and open data standards 

Heledd has been joining the dots between us and the Data team, including: 

+ requests sent to us to publish spreadsheets of data and the data team’s requirements around open standards
+ approaches to publishing data dashboards (Power BI)
+ the open data process for Wales
+ opportunities for us to work together 

We have a meeting with Data soon to explore these issues and find out what they know about users’ pain points and needs. 

## More stuff going on 

+ Alex has been working on renewing some of our software contracts and arrangements for new website auditing tools
+ Toyah joined Content Design Cymru’s webinar on [how generative AI can help online content easier to read](https://digitalanddata.blog.gov.wales/tag/llm/)
+ Toyah’s worked on [a new gateway page for a marine cabling guidance PDF](https://naturalresources.wales/guidance-and-advice/business-sectors/marine/marine-cabling-activities-in-wales-information-to-support-environmental-assessments/?lang=en) (we came up with the gateway page idea to help users find the PDF, and decide – from the page summary – if the content is for them without having to download a large document)
+ James is working on ‘send a flood message’ analysis, compiling user needs, pain points and general insights
+ Shaun has been working on content for planning and development
+ Soph and Kim are happy with the new backlog/ workflow system and have given feedback for small tweaks to Alex   

## In other news 

We have another new team member – Monti, our Digital Purresident (thanks Sophie!). He’s been a bit disruptive during meetings this week, snapping a houseplant in half, discovering how to swing a framed picture back and forth and inserting lots of ‘rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr’s in Sam’s emails. He’s cute, so we’ll forgive him.
