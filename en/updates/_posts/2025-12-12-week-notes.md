Here’s what the Digital team has been up to this week...

## Team Birds update  

It’s been another busy week in the nest! Here’s what we’ve done: 

+ Designed a new confirmation page for the ‘Change a species licence’ form  
+ Created more fields in the form so users can add or remove up to 10 people on a licence  
+ Created more fields in the form so users can update personal details for up to 5 people named on a licence  
+ Updated the design decision document with feedback from subject matter experts about the section where users can extend a licence end date. We’ll make changes to the prototype in the next few days  
+ Prepared questions for our next meeting with subject matter experts. We want to learn more about which techniques and equipment users can change, so we can update the prototype  
+ Reviewed applications where users selected the ‘Other’ route to understand unusual cases and discuss them with subject matter experts  

Jane has also had a very busy week, she: 

+ continued work on the Forest Management Plan project with Sam 
+ joined Bird and Intranet project meetings (thanks for having me!) 
+ met with Lucinda to learn about her Flood work 
+ had a collaborative session with Mary to explore implementing the accordion component into some Days Out pages 
+ attended NRW induction - interesting to learn more about the wider organisation and meet more colleagues  

## Other things we have been up to: 

+ Mary covered for the Recreation team who were on an awayday and updated the i-boxes on the pages about visiting several woodlands pages  as car parks and other facilities were closed due to Storm Bram. 
+ Mary and Jane started to experiment with the new accordion feature in Umbraco. 
+ The publishing elves have been busy working their way through the Christmas rush of jobs 
+ We have had a few requests coming in to us lately where the content has been signed off, or the subject matter expert (for various reasons) isn't keen on content design. In some of these cases we will have to go ahead and publish the content as it is and we are logging these as non-compliant.
