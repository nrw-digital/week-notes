Storm Bert swept through this week, causing flooding and damage up and down the country. We hope you are all safe and unaffected. 

With how busy the Team have been this week, it will be a short read today

## Heledd’s adventure 

Heledd spent nine hours driving to Cardiff and back for workshops, as storm damage meant that the trains were cancelled.

There was a silver lining to this cloud though, as it meant nine fewer hours in front of a screen, and instead she was able to listen to the following recommended podcasts:

+ [Dead Ends: Legacy — Good Services](https://good.services/deadendspodcast/legacy)
+ [Dead Ends Podcast, Episode 4, Vernacular — Good Services](https://good.services/deadendspodcast/vernacular)
+ [Y Pumed Llawr - The Fifth Floor Podcast — Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/y-pumed-llawr-the-fifth-floor/id1780853972)
+ [Phoenixed: Inside Canada’s payroll disaster Podcast on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/4LRTWaWuWsP0Z9OdfR0ufM)

There was also time to listen to some more of [All Through the Night: Why Our Lives Depend on Dark Skies.](https://soundcloud.com/harpercollinspublishers/all-through-the-night-why-our)

## Update to weeknotes landing page

Following a recent weeknote entry, where we had a quest writer [Miki Miyata-Lee](https://nrw-digital.github.io/week-notes/en/updates/2024/11/15/week-notes.html). Owain had taken a look to see how we could improve our previous weeknotes on the main landing page. 

You will now be able to see how has written each entry of our weeknotes and it will include a short description. The short description has been taken from the first line of each entry and it was surprising to see how often we start out weeknotes with “Well, it has been another busy week”. 

Owain will continue to review the Weeknotes site and how it can be improved. 

## Other things we’ve been working on

+ James is working on his presentation for the show and tell about our species licensing user interviews next week
+ Toyah finished writing a post for our blog – look out for it going live in mid-December 
+ Owain had received an update with the recent Climate Literacy training. With confirmation from Cynnal Cymru – Sustain Wales, that his evidence form will now be passed on to The Carbon Literacy Project in Manchester for certification.
+ Owain had created a new Google dashboard for our content that is on Citizen Space. 

## Fun fact 

With November coming to a close, it is interesting to know that William Shakespeare apparently wasn’t all too fond of November. Hailed as one of the all-time greatest writers of English literature, Shakespeare wrote 154 sonnets and 37 plays which are still in production today. In all of the works that Shakespeare wrote, the month of November isn’t mentioned a single time.
