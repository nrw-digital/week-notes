description:  What we’ve been up to in the Digital Team this week.

We've had another busy week in the Digital Team, with some rain, some sunshine and a few of the team on annual leave. Here's what we've been up to this week…

## Improving content in line with user behaviour 
 
This week, Laura has made some iterations to the 'using land we manage' web pages. Previously we had a link to an external organisation for users who needed help setting up community projects on land we manage. However the link was in a prime location and users were using it to ask more general enquiry type questions that should be coming to our customer hub.  
 
With help from Lucinda and Sam, Laura created a new page for people that need help with community projects - this includes a simply enquiry form which is sent to the external organisation we work with. 

Hopefully this makes things clearer for users and helps solve the problem. 

## New and improved bird licensing content 
 
Phil, Sam and Laura published the new Bird licensing pages. 

The restructure follows the standard pattern that we are using across the website. While the content itself hasn't really changed, it's the first step of what is a really big piece of work to improve the species permitting content on the website. The next step is to publish the fish-eating bird content in a couple of week time.  

This is what the content looked like before and after.

+ Kim has also been learning how to publish protected site documents, and now has god-tier status on Hornbill 
+ Mary has been redeveloping the staff benefits web page ready for the launch of the new e-recruitment system
