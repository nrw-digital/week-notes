Not long to go, we’re counting down the days until Christmas. This week we’ve been finishing off all we can ahead of the festivities…

## It’s Christmas Jumper Day 2024!
This year, the team dusted off their Christmas jumpers for our team call on Thursday 12 December. We might be a serious team with proper work to do, but there’s nothing stopping us from having a festive time while we do it! 

Getting into a jolly spirit ahead of the holidays was the perfect way to end the year!

## A new sign-in service for users

After many months of work for Lucinda and the flood product team, the sign in to your flood warnings account service has gone live! Users who sign up for flood warnings can now sign in to update their details or cancel warnings. 

Thrown in with the release are some styling and language improvements across the whole service.

## Other things we’ve been working on:

+ Sophie has been busy publishing our monthly permitting reports this week. This is the time of year where we receive a small snowstorm of content to be published before the Christmas holidays, so please bear with us as we prioritise according to external deadlines ahead of the break
+ This week we’ve worked with subject matter experts to publish information on our websites to align with new content published on the Welsh Government’s website. Tasks like this require individuals across teams to work collaboratively to meet externally set deadlines. Creating accessible Welsh language PDF content to host on our website, new links to the latest information as well as the translation and scheduling of the content are all key steps in ensuring we meet deadlines and provide all the necessary guidance to our users
+ Working with the Industry and Waste Regulatory Approaches team, Shaun has now finalised how the website will display guidance on complying with an Environmental Permit for industry. Permit holders were required to follow Best Available Techniques standards set out in documents published by the EU. Following Brexit however, the UK is developing its own Best Available Techniques documents which will be coming into effect piecemeal over the next few years. Previously we had displayed all of these documents on one page, meaning users had to sift through lots of technical documents that were irrelevant to them. The new approach will be to have sector specific pages underneath the main industry landing page. This should mean that the guidance is easier for users to find and consume. A fortuitous side-effect is that these pages should also be quicker and easier for us in the digital team to update, given that there will be numerous and regular updates as further BAT and ‘additional guidance’ documents are published. The pages are away for translation but should be published on the site next week
+ Shaun and Alex met with the Regulatory Business Management Team to discuss the next round of charging updates. In general we agreed that the charging pages for each permitting area that were published last year are doing their job and there is no need to overhaul the ‘Charging Scheme for Environmental Permitting’. We’ve agreed to review the Installation Environmental Permitting charging page as numerous changes to how these are applied have been introduced in the last few months and the page is currently ‘complex’ at best

## Friday Fun Fact - Christmas wasn't always on December 25

Although Christmas celebrates the birth of Christ, it doesn’t actually mention December 25 anywhere in the bible. In fact, some historians think [Jesus was born in the spring]( https://www.history.com/news/why-is-christmas-celebrated-on-december-25), not the winter at all! Christmas on December 25th wasn't celebrated until about 336 AD.
