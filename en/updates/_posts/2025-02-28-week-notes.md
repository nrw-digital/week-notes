Happy Ramadan to all who are celebrating, and welcome to another instalment in our week notes - here’s what we’ve been up to this week…

## Supporting your Muslim friends and colleagues during Ramadan… 

This year, Ramadan will begin on Saturday 1 march 2025 and end on Sunday 30 March 2025, depending on the sighting of the moon. Muslim communities across the UK and around the world will soon be making plans to prepare for the month of fasting.  

Reach out to your Muslim friends and colleagues to ask how they are. One of the best ways you can show respect, solidarity, and support for the people observing Ramadan in your community is to be open to learning more.

## Why user research matters… 
User research is at the heart of any good content and service. 
 
It is a way to better understand user behaviour, needs, context, values, and problems. The first step to creating content that meets user needs is understanding what those needs are. 

To learn more about the people accessing our content, we must gather as much information about our users to inform the design.  

There is value in understanding: 
+ who your likely users are 
+ what they’re trying to do 
+ what users need from you to achieve their goal – this can be an outcome, or just gaining knowledge 
+ how they currently do it (for example, the website or channels they’re using to access advice) 
+ the problems or frustrations they experience while doing so 
+ what language they use to express their need 

Testing your build with users can help you identify problems you may have not considered. Spotting these issues early on can save time and ensure you are creating the best possible product.

## Celebrating St David’s Day… 
Our team is looking forward to St. David’s Day on Saturday March 1st, also known as Dydd Gŵyl Dewi Sant, which is a national holiday in Wales that celebrates the patron saint of Wales, St. David. 

Celebrating St. David’s Day allows individuals to embrace and showcase Welsh culture and heritage. Here are some ways to celebrate this special day: 
+ Wear a leek or daffodil: Traditionally, people wear a leek or a daffodil, which are national symbols of Wales, on St. David’s Day. It’s a visible display of Welsh pride. 
+ Enjoy Welsh cuisine: Savor traditional Welsh dishes like cawl (a hearty soup), Welsh rarebit (cheese on toast), and Welsh cakes (delicious pastries). 
+ Attend parades and festivals: Many towns and cities in Wales organize parades, concerts, and cultural festivals to mark the occasion. Join in the festivities and enjoy Welsh music and dance. 
+ Learn about Welsh history: Take the opportunity to learn about the history and contributions of Wales and its people. You can also visit museums or historical sites. 
+ Support local artisans: Purchase Welsh crafts, artwork, and souvenirs made by local artisans to support the local economy. 
+ Volunteer in your local community: Why not give back this holiday by volunteering your time at a local animal shelter or charity? There’s so many worthwhile causes on our doorstep, the only challenge is finding the time!

St. David’s Day is a time for people in Wales and around the world to come together and celebrate their Welsh heritage, culture, and the legacy of St. David. It’s a day of pride, traditions, and festivities that strengthen the bonds of the Welsh community.  

Even the dogs at Cardiff Dog’s Home tend to get involved in the Welsh celebrations, so why not spend the day with some of the beautiful pets looking for homes in your local shelter!

## Other things we’ve been working on… 
+ This week, Phil, Kim and Sophie scouted out possible locations for the annual GovCamp event. We have found a place with plenty of natural light and space for all the attendees, including break out spaces for smaller group work. We loved the new space as it’s a larger accessible space that fits everybody.
+ Sam and Phil continue to work on the species content and forms. We met with a subject matter expert from the bird licensing team to find out more about their licensing process. The next step will be to take the new form and web content to the team to get our work fact checked.
+ Heledd’s highlight this week includes stepping outside for a couple of daytime power walks. It’s helped her de-stress and get a bit of perspective on things. She’s also started to listen to the 'Let them theory' audiobook - as it claims to help you not worry so much about things that are beyond our control, and be more in control of what you can do yourself.
