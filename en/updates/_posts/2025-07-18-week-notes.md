## What we've been doing this week 
--- 

+ Owain had been working through the new enhancements for both NRW and WCP websites. With regression underway, the Team will look to release these enhancements in the next few weeks. 

+ This week, Hannah and Sophie worked their way through the publishing queue. Several high-profile pollution and storm reports has been published, alongside urgent updates to content across the Intranet and website. They also supported subject matter experts with writing appropriate alt-text for accessible evidence reports. 

+ Alex attended a User story mapping workshop at the CGI (BJSS) office. The workshop was mapping out the user story for Marine band 1 for the customer platform project. 

+ Sam, Phil and Laura continue to work on the species project. This week the new structure for bird licensing pages, and the new fish eating birds application form content have been sent to the translation team. The new fish eating birds application form has been completed and tested by a user and we have received their feedback. 

+ Heledd had two busy networking evenings this week.

On Wednesday, she joined a senior leadership event with the Centre for Digital Public Services. Interesting evening with three senior leaders talking about leading transformation in public services. 

Then on Thursday, Heledd spoke at Content Design London’s first community event in Cardiff. This was quite a personal journey, about our team’s journey and the quiet power of content design in transforming services.  

The proudest moment? The questions and conversations that followed. Not just for Heledd, but for the team. It was brilliant to see our work spark interest.  

## Volunteering 

Hannah organised a volunteering day on Thursday 17th July to encourage team building and occupational health while benefitting some local good causes.  

Hannah, Lucinda and Laura headed to sapling care/bracken beating, with [Cambrian Wildwoods](https://www.cambrianwildwood.org/). On a wet day the team were cutting back bracken to help protect and encourage wild saplings trees growth.
