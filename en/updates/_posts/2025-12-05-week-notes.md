Here's what the Digital team have been up to this week...

Sam and Jane continued work on the discovery phase of the Forest Management Plans project:
+ mapped out proposed question flow
+ mapped out existing guidance
+ identified questions for SMEs
+ met with SMEs to get answers to questions 

Here’s an update from birds HQ this week. We were really excited to have Jane join us in the nest on Tuesday 😊  

+ Sent subject matter experts a section of the form for comment – hoping for feedback by Monday 8 December to keep things on-track
+ Designed the ‘add a species’ section of the form with different routing depending on the type of licence
+ Added a route for users to change techniques and equipment – to be discussed with subject matter experts
+ Added a route for users to change the location - to be discussed with subject matter experts
+ Set up meetings with subject matter experts for the next few weeks and begun preparing discussion points 

Other things we have been up to: 

+ This week, Sophie has continued work on our SoNaRR 2025 HTML web content, by actioning feedback from user research and subject matter experts to ensure this content is optimised for our users.
+ Sophie really enjoyed her first Welsh language course with Dysgu Cymraeg, the atmosphere was really welcoming and she's excited to learn more in the coming lessons.
+ Mary and Sophie updated the homepage and splash images with a new wintery scene captured at an NRW site.

+ James, Alex, Shaun, Mary, Kim, and Jane met to decide the next steps for the intranet improvement project.
+ Lucinda has been improving the design of our internal flood messaging system. The updates are now in development, and she is reviewing each change as it becomes ready.
+ Lucinda has also been restructuring her Figma files into smaller, more coherent sets instead of the single MEGAFILE she has been battling with. She plans to complete this during the quieter Christmas period (as a treat).
+ Shaun met with the flood team to talk about information perceived to be missing from a couple of pieces of content aimed at watercourse side property owners. He also continued to work on Landscape and visual impacts of developments guidance and commented on peatland guidance being developed by an expert group.
+ Sam pressed 'publish' on the long-awaited Fly-tipping Action Wales pages [Fly-tipping Action Wales](https://naturalresources.wales/about-us/what-we-do/fly-tipping-action-wales/?lang=en).
+ Sam joined a session with a new cross government community about service patterns. [A recap is available: Service Patterns UK](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE01pVvszYu0tWVbn31DINw).

+ Heledd met with Cecile in the CRM team to talk about opportunities for better data insights from customer hub – it's quite manual at the moment, and hard to measure reduction in contact after we improve the website.
+ We've received a new draft PowerBi dashboard report of all our publishing and design requests – lots of interesting data, and potential for better, clearer reporting.
+ Heledd joined the Comms team meeting to share an update on out of hours process for any emergency website updates required. Important this time of year as we head into holiday time and more potential storms.
+ Kim, Phil and Sophie attended the NRW Christmas market on Wednesday. It was wonderful to see all the handmade items as well as sampling the delicious baked goods at the charity bake sale. It was a lovely opportunity to raise some much needed donations for Huggard homeless charity and to support our creative members of staff.
