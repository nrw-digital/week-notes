Here’s what the Digital team have been up to this week…  

+ This week marks the end of building the ‘change a species licence’ prototype. The last two sections of the form are now ready to share with SMEs for comment. 

+ Sam and Jane shared an early prototype with forest management plan subject matter experts. This generated further discussion around the need for users to be able to amend elements of the form post-submission, so our next step is to prototype a solution for this. 

+ NRW has just published data (PDFs and Excel files) on species and habitats in Wales - a requirement under Habitats Regulations. For the digital team, this involved advising colleagues on creating accessible documents as well as creating a website page structure to help users find and move around the data as easily as possible. For the first time, we used a [searchable table containing links to documents](https://naturalresources.wales/evidence-and-data/research-and-reports/habitats-regulations-9a-report-for-wales-2019-2024-non-bird-species-data/?lang=en). There is a feedback form on the page to hopefully help us understand if this approach works for users. 

+ James has been making stylistic changes to SoNaRR 2025. He's also been changing the urls for maps in service as we move to a new GIS platform. He's also preparing for three workshops with Enabling Services next week to better understand the issues users have with their intranet pages 

+ Shaun and Mary continued writing task based content for the intranet project.  

+ Shaun met with an expert group looking at how we can raise awareness amongst owners of riverside properties of their responsibilities.   

+ This week, Sophie has been working on clearing jobs out of her queue, actioning SoNaRR2025 feedback and performing accessibility audits for teams across the organisation. Another busy but varied week!
