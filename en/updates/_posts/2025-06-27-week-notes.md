## What we have been working on this week:â€¯


+ This week, Sophie and Hannah went through the accessibility checking process together. We ran checks on a series of documents, using both Adobe and Word to check for a series of accessibility faults, including correcting inaccessible tables and adding missing alt-text to PDF documents. In the coming weeks, Hannah will test our new LMS content on accessibility to provide feedback and ensure our guidance is clear and easy to follow.
+ We've looked at feedback from the team and re-set our direction for weeknotes. We'll be keeping them focussed on what we've done and learnt as a team.
+ Laura has temporarily joined the species team. Laura has been working on making changes to the interim web pages based on the feedback from subject matter experts. These interim pages are designed to restructure existing web content. This will enable the team to publish the new content into the correct structure as it is developed.
+ The Species team (Sam, Phil and Laura) have started to explore the change / vary / amend bird licence forms and content. Our aim is to improve and combine three separate Word forms into one digital online form.
+ Alex, Sam and Owain have attended a backlog refinement meeting with our Umbraco developers. During this meeting we discussed feasibility & solutions, assigned effort / sizing and prioritised the tasks.
+ Alex, Sam and Lucinda have been working with our Umbraco developers to ensure that the design elements to a new accordion pattern are in line with our and Gov.uk design system.
+ Heledd's still focussing on trying to get our team's priorities defined, and busy in setting up governance, and ways of working for the Customer Platform Private Beta phase.

Last Thursday, Phil, Kim and Sophie attended the 'Civil Service responding to Social Change' LGBTQIA+ Event in Cathays Park Some also watched the live-stream, that was available to those that could not be there in person. 

The event was designed to tackle discrimination in the workplace, and had a variety of speakers who vulnerably shared their experiences to highlight the continuing need to stand against prejudice and misinformation.

It was a valuable reminder of the role we can all play as allies, and the importance of supporting colleagues who may face discrimination.

Events like these help us listen, learn and reflect on what more we can do to make Natural Resources Wales a safe and inclusive place for everyone, whatever their identity.
