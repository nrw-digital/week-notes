Our accessibility audit of the main website, form builder and public register is underway. We're categorising accessibility non-compliances to help us create a fixing plan. 

The intranet team created more new content and are looking at styling and other design elements. 

Phil and Laura continued work on bird licensing forms: ongoing work on the change a licence form and some discovery work into returns and renewal.  

Shaun has been working with SMEs on the topic of river ownership and responsibilities, including discussing terms like 'riparian ownership' and 'ordinary watercourses' - although NRW might understand them, many users do not.  

On Monday, the customer platform/ marine licensing service private beta went live.

Jane and Sam met forestry SMEs, sharing MIRO designs and discussing options for making it easier for users to apply for a forest management plan. They agreed to test a prototype form that is a mix of document upload and text fields. They want to test the assumption that it will be easier for users to upload documents than complete long complex form tables. Documents would also be easier for the user to amend if NRW required it. 

Phil and Sam added a feedback survey to more forms, expanding the 'feedback dashboard' to give easy to access insights into users' experiences across our services. 

Hannah, Kim and Sophie have been busy publishing new content and updating old content across the website, intranet and other platforms this week. From publishing new guidance and information about equality and diversity, amending SoNaRR 2025 web content and performing numerous evidence report accessibility audits, this week has been a productive but exciting one! Bring on the weekend!  

Mary attended an AI course at Cardiff University, organised by CDPS. She's also preparing to deliver training for comms colleagues over the next few weeks. 

Sam worked with waste SMEs on revisions to 'how to classify and assess waste', as well as more detailed guidance for waste permit holders.
