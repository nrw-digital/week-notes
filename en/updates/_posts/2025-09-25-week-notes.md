## Highlights from the week in digital

+ Lucinda has been working with Sarah in the flood team to identify pain points and opportunities in a user journey, with a view to improve the user experience and duty officer efficiency during a flood event.
+ Lucinda has also been working on screen designs in Figma to get prepared for future development sprints.
+ Shaun has finalised and gained agreement for the guidance for Siting electricity grid infrastructure.
+ Laura is doing well as she updates the online Flood Risk Activity Permit (FRAP) forms. The FRAP team has always supported making the application easier for users. Theyâ€™re even happy to promote our work and encourage other teams engage with us.

## Team birds have had another busy week:

+ Laura has been looking at the protected species additional information submission form (what a title!). Laura has been gathering data from the form to check just what additional information is submitted to the team
+ Phil and Laura updated the fish-eating birds form and web content pages. Users have to tell us about many different bird counts. It turns out users were adding every bird count to just one area of the form, instead of splitting up the data. We made changes to improve this area of the form and updated the web content to match
+ We started prepping for our kick off meeting with the species team. Created a couple of slides to explain the scope of the project
+ We then updated the scoping document with new information about our timescales for this project
