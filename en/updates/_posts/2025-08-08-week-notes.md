A bit of a short update as it's been a busy old week for our little team. Here's what we've been up to… 

+ Phil, Kim & Hannah have continued to work through the bug checking and 2i-ing of the Smart Survey forms.
+ Sophie met with subject matter experts to better understand their needs for Intranet content and share suggestions to help their content stand out and support users in completing a task. 
+ Sophie and Hannah have continued working on a rather large report that is due to be published later next month. With over 30 pages of content, including tables, images and charts, this is a big piece of work that we've been collaborating on in recent weeks. Stay tuned!
+ Mary ran a content crit session with fellow content designers to get feedback on the new pages about working for NRW.
+ Kim worked on a massive request of publishing 41 consultations - she now needs to go and lay in a dark room and never see another consultation again… 
+ James has been working with our delivery partners to plan recruiting users for our marine licensing beta.  
+ Toyah has also been working with our partner service designers on a site map and content audit.  
+ Together they also examined a number of Hotjar recordings of real user behaviour on the band 1 marine web content that was launched last September. It was interesting to see how people interact with our site, and a few insights were gleaned (or at least, best guesses!).  
+ Toyah has also been putting the final touches in place for the upcoming relaunch of the band 1 marine licence application form (version 2.0!).  

Heledd has been at the Eisteddfod this week – mainly on holiday, but she also:  

+ Worked on the NRW stand, where the focus has been on peatland restoration work, including trying to crowdsource a Welsh name for a rare new bug! 
+ Went to the launch of the new book on accessibility with CDPS. The speakers were Jeremy Evans from Welsh Government, Efa Gruffudd, the Welsh language commissioner, and Rob, a young man born blind, who spoke powerfully about the fact that digital public services don’t work for him in Welsh. We look forward to this book and the mission for access for all being shared more widely. 
+ Went to a talk about Digital Health Wales, which was interesting., particularly hearing about the  challenges of getting data in lots of different systems to integrate and work better so that patient records work better. There were some interesting challenges about Welsh language services in the audience too. 
+ Was joined by Lucinda at the Bangor University stand, to attend the launch of the Welsh language and AI guidance by CDPS and the Welsh language commissioner.
