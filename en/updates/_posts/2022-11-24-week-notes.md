Five things that happened this week.

## 1. We got to know each other

We reflected, recorded, then shared with the group things about ourselves like: 
*	our ideal way to learn
*	how we like to receive feedback
*	what we need
*	conditions we like to work in

We were a new group, with many of us having never met before, so this gave us the opportunity to learn more about each other and settle in for the day.  

## 2. We got to know GitHub 

We moved on to practical stuff fast. To help us make and publish during the project, we started using a project site hosted on GitHub. We used it to:
* create bios
*	compile principles for our learning
*	try out GitHub Markdown
*	publish it all bilingually

GitHub was new to some of us content people, so it was great to experiment with it.

## 3. We explored a service problem

Our challenge for the day was to design a menu for a festival event. To do this we:
*	created a recruitment screener
*	prepared discussion guide
*	carried out a simulation of a user recruitment exercise
*	held mock-up user interviews

This helped us create a menu to meet users’ needs.

## 4. We created a service blueprint

To map out the user journey we created a service blueprint. It included:
*	what the user does
*	what the user sees
*	what the user doesn’t see
*	what supports the service

This helped us map out the service end to end and identify potential pain points. 

## 5. We carried out a desktop walkthrough

Each group chose a problem and prototyped a solution using lego and other props. This helped simulate how the service might play out during the festival.
