Another week of projects, problems and publishing here in the Digital Team!

## Here are some highlights from the week... 

+ Mary has finished a substantial piece of work on new content to guide users through the new e-recruitment system. Soph has supported with a lot of speedy intranet publishing. 

+ Form bug fixing continues for longer than we thought it would. Annual leave and other projects extended the timeline a bit – maybe we were over ambitious. We've almost finished the first phase and Sam and Phil and working on a recommendations report to help us decide what we take forward for improvement or redesign. 

+ Sam, Hannah and Sophie met to discuss problems they've had with Citizen Space this week following an upgrade to their system. They found a creative workaround to a known bug which meant none of the team's work (publishing consultations) was affected.  

+ Toyah launched an interim version of the band 1 marine licensing form, while we wait for GOV.UK Pay to be set up in the background. This update implements a number of tweaks to improve question clarity and small process changes.  

+ James has been involving in user interviews for our marine licensing Beta. We’re speaking to eight people in this round. He also met with colleagues to discuss a survey to learn more about user needs for our installations content.  

+ Toyah has also been taking notes during the user research interviews for the customer platform Beta project - it's been an insight to hear the opinions and feedback of a variety of applicants from different industries and fields. 

+ Sophie and Hannah have continued working through the backlog, despite a reduced team this week due to annual leave. In between calls, we've run accessibility audits on evidence reports and worked with subject matter experts to publish new content onto our website and intranet.  

+ Heledd ran a retro for the recently completed phase of species work – there was some good learning around role clarification, better communication and setting scope. 

+ Shaun has tweaked some of the wording on the ‘Report an incident’ form to hopefully make it easier for reporters to pick the category of incident. He’s also working on a page of guidance for building developers on siting electricity infrastructure and has just started working on guidance for developers when dealing with peat.
