Who are we? What day is it again? Is it still acceptable to source my breakfast from the Quality Street tin?

The time between Christmas and New Years is a bit disorientating, but a few of us are still working to make sure the good ship digital is chugging along nicely into the new year. 

## Starting off as we mean to go on

We’re using this time to clean up and organise the inbox and get our ‘to-do’ lists ready for 2024. 

Also, during the quieter period around Christmas and the new year, we’ve been working our way through the backlog of tasks, picking up what we can and moving other pieces of work forward. This means a lot of the non-time sensitive work on the Intranet has been completed, along with a variety of reports and document accessibility checks.

We wanted to share some feedback from us that has been gleaned as we review the outstanding content request forms from 2024. 

One theme that we are consistently seeing is lots of content request forms which do not include all the necessary information to complete a request. Forms that have been submitted without all the details needed to action the request cause delays for both your team and ours.
Whether you’re missing the URL of the webpage, or the updated link address or even the webpage copy, **this is all important information that must be given to us when you first get in touch**. 

Before sending in your content request forms, check that:

+ You have clearly communicated the changes needed. Tracked changes in a Word document attachment can be the best way to do this. 
+ Double check the links and attachments you have included are all accessible by our/other teams. If you need to update your privacy settings, please do that. 
+ Share your request with a colleague before pressing send, to check that you have provided all the necessary information for us to pick up your request. We call this a 2i check in our team, and it’s a great way to make sure what you’re communicating makes sense.

## And finally...

A little bit of humour to end the year with: Why did 2023 go by in a blur?

My resolution must have been too low.

We hope you’ve had a wonderful Christmas and you have an incredible start to 2024. See you in the new year!
