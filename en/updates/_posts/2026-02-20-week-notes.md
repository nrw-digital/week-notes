##This week...

*The new Pay, Pensions and People Services intranet pages were published, which should help staff to find important information more easily and reduce queries coming through to individual teams and staff members. Hannah worked with the Pay and People Services manager over the course of a few months to complete this work, both were glad to finally tick it off the to-do list 😊
