## This week...

As the curling stone of destiny slid remorselessly toward the death knell of integrity, the digital team hammered on regardless: 

+ Mary and Sophie met with other NRW teams to discuss stories for our new DDaT bulletin, designed to capture and share some of the valuable work, projects and achievements taking place throughout the Digital, Data and Technology teams. This week, we determined which stories have internal staff interest and created a template for our team to record notable work throughout the month to share with the wider organisation.

+ The new Pay, Pensions and People Services intranet pages were published, which should help staff to find important information more easily and reduce queries coming through to individual teams and staff members. Hannah worked with the Pay and People Services manager to complete this work, both were glad to finally tick it off the to-do list 😊 

+ Shaun, Mary and Kim carried on working on new intranet content. They met with James to discuss outputs from workshops he'd hosted with enabling services teams aimed at understanding business needs, user needs and frustrations with current intranet content. 

+ Shaun pored over some real world enquiries about river maintenance and responsibilities to attempt to understand common user needs in the area. 

+ Laura and Phil had another highly productive meeting with the lovely Species Team. Together with Carys and Amy, they worked through a particularly complex section of the Change a Species Licence form. They then spent the rest of their time developing two new forms: the reference form and the bat trainer endorsement form. These new forms can be completed and then uploaded to the change, renew and apply forms, helping to create a smoother and more user‑friendly experience. 

+ Mary and Jane worked on the content for new parking arrangements at three of our sites. They're now awaiting approval from subject matter experts on content for one site before finalising and publishing on the website.

+ Sam and Jane have been further refining the forest management plan prototype following a positive meeting with subject matter experts last week.   

+ Phil and Sophie met to discuss the next steps on our LMS modules from a content design perspective, having collated a range of staff feedback to ensure the final course covers all questions and queries raised by staff regarding accessible documents.

+ Sam and Alex took a first look at a new job to create an online process for water companies to self-report pollution incidents.
