Here’s what the Digital team has been up to this week... 

+ Laura and Phil from Team Birds had a very productive session with the species subject matter experts.

They had several unanswered questions about the change form prototype they’re developing and were keen to gather insights from the experts.

During the session, they worked closely with the lovely species team to explore:
	
+ How to extend a species licence
+ How to add a new ecologist to a species licence
+ How to add or change the number of species
+ When and how users need to update their method statement

This collaboration helped Laura and Phil understand the process better and will shape the next steps for the prototype design work.

## Other things we've been working on:

+ Sophie attended Islamophobia Awareness Month Webinar. November is Islamophobia Awareness Month, and the Equality & Diversity team kindly organised for an external speaker from MEND Cymru to deliver a session on the rise of abuse towards the Muslim community. With prejudice on the rise, it’s more important than ever to learn how to define and identify Islamophobia, understand key drivers and how to challenge this form of racism through practical solutions.
+ Phil attended an 'AI in the workplace' course. He learnt all about how Notebook LLM can analyse lots of documents and then summarise the content, saving lots of time. Notebook LLM can even create podcasts of your document summaries. He also learnt how to use prompts and language in AI models to get the best results.
+ Another busy week of publishing! This week, our team prepared a series of high-profile reports for publication, provided accessibility guidance to a number of teams and updated guidance on our internal and external websites.
+ Sophie and Sam met to discuss next steps on a larger piece of work they’ve been working on together.
+ Shaun and Mary have now completed the content audit of intranet pages with over 100 views in the last twelve months and compiled a list of all user needs and user stories. Shaun has also been working on guidance for developers working in peatland areas and updated guidance on carbon trading. 
+ James is prepping for user research workshops with Enabling Services teams. This will help us understand the types of issues staff face when using our services on the intranet. 
+ Sam worked on designing pages for an upcoming Wales-wide Habitats Regulations report. Working with colleagues in environmental reporting has been really positive, plus they've taken accessibility super-seriously - following best practice in all their documents (100s of them!). This week we focused on structuring the pages, final decisions on alt text in documents and how we'd gather feedback from users.
